The terms LBRP and LIRP refer to two different types of spiritual or magical rituals, often used in ceremonial magic. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

üúÅ LBRP ‚Äì Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
Purpose: Banishing unwanted energies and protecting the space.

Use: It's one of the most foundational and commonly used rituals in Western ceremonial magic (especially within the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and similar traditions).

Structure:

Relaxation and grounding

Qabalistic Cross

Drawing pentagrams at four directions (usually banishing Earth pentagrams)

Invocation of archangels (Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, Uriel)

Final Qabalistic Cross

Effect: Clears a space energetically, establishes spiritual boundaries, and aligns the magician with divine forces.

üúÉ LIRP ‚Äì Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram
Purpose: Invoking or drawing in specific elemental energies.

Use: Used when a practitioner wants to bring in particular elemental forces (Earth, Air, Fire, or Water) into a space or themselves.

Structure: Nearly identical to LBRP, but the invoking pentagrams are drawn instead of the banishing ones.

Effect: Charges the area with desired energies; used in magical workings or meditative practice where enhancement or attraction is needed.
